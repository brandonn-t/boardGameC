This project creates the board game "Hey thats my Fish" which is playable against an AI in the console.
Hey thats my Fish is a board game where players play on a grid where each tile is able to move in 8 directions (up, left, right, diagonal, etc.)
The goal of the game is to step on the tiles with 1, 2, 3 fish on them and collect them. The player to collect the most fish wins.
